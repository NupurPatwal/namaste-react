9. The packages in package.jsom are known as dependencies.
10. our project is dependent on a lot of packages. and those projects in which our project is dependent on called dependencies.
11. and takes care of that.
12. NPM also manages what is the version of that package. npm also take care of it.
13. And it will take on the file named package.json
14. package.json is the configration of npm.

## what is the most imp package in our project?

ANs it is a bundler.

15. we have html, css and js file before it will sent to production our code needs to be cleand and compressed. SO a bundler helps us to do all that thing. 16. For eg. webpack, vite and parcel are bundlers.

## what is the role of bundler?

ans. bundler packaged your app properly so that it can be shipped to production.

15. We are using parcel
16. There are two types of packages
    a. dev dependencies and b. normal dep

17. dev dep. used in development phase and m=normal dependencis are used in production aldo.
18. What is transtive dependencies?
    Ans. the dep. on which parcel is running is running is based on other dep.
19. node modules are the colllection of depemdencies.
20. If we have package.json and package-log.json we can regenrate the node modules.

## Questions:

1. What is npm?
2. Why do we we need this package.json file?
3. is package.json & package-lock.json are same?
4. What is the integrity?
5. Did we need to push our package.json and package-lock.json?
   > yes absoultely bc package.json and package-lock.json maintain all the dependencies that our projects need.

## Points to Remember:-

1. there are lots of pakages that are used to build the production ready app.
2. Npm doesn't have a full form.
3. npm is the standard library for all the packages.
4. The Package.json file is the configration of npm.
5. the packages which npm gives us are also known as dependencies.
6. Create react app is using web pack and bundler behind the scenes.
7. webpack, vite and parcel are the types of bundlers using now a days.
8. all the bundlers are doing the same thing with certain d/f algorithm.
9. What is npm install -D parcel? ==> There are 2 types of dependencies
   a. dev dependencies = It is generally required in a development phase.
   b. normal dependencies = It is use inproduction also.

10. As we are installing parcel as a dev dependency.
11. And we are going to tell the package manager that I want parcel into the app.
12. In our package.json we got this parcel as a dev dependency.

## Points to Remember:-

1. package-lock.json keep the track of exact version that has been installed.
2. package-lock.json kind of locks the version and keep the record of it.
3. What is the integrity
4. If I had my package and package.log I can regenertae my node modules.
5. What so ever you can regenerate do notput it on git.
